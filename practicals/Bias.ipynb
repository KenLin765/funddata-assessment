One key person in history, I always think myself is Christopher Columbus, what I think you read in a text book, is a subset of what he actually did. \n",

They have no iron, their javelins being without it, and nothing more than sticks, though some have fish-bones or other things at the ends. It appears to me, that the people are ingenious, and would be good servants and I am of opinion that they would very readily become Christians, as they appear to have no religion.\"\n",

The key finding that I took from reading the article was to always be open to changing your mind based on someone else's opinion if it is more efficient and more scalable for further projects based on an opinion by another person or maybe a change in technology and develop as many hypotheses based on the subject as you can.\n",
