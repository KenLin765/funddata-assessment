# Fundamentals of Data Analysis Assessment

by Kenneth Linehan

## Introduction: 

I am a student studying the fundamentals of data analysis in ATU.

This assessment will looks at some of the key topics in data analysis such as information, randomness, outliers, bias and data cleansing.

This will also include a normal distribution notebook, which looks into some of the key concepts with visualisation of how they work.
